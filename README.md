Whereabouts is a ReactNative application which allows a user to view a map of tweets of those they follow.  
Our goal is to give an alternative view of our surroundings by mapping social interactions on twitter.
The application is interactive, user focused, and simply designed.  

Currently this application is built for Android devices.  Contributions to the ios code will be welcomed after december 22, 2019.

WhereAbouts is designed and developed by Clara Fairbanks, Aaron Lopez and Liudmila Zyrianova.
